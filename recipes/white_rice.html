    <h1>White Rice</h1>

    <img src="../images/rice.JPG">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        White rice is milled rice that has had its husk, bran, and germ removed. This alters the flavor, texture and appearance of the rice and helps prevent spoilage, extend its storage life, and makes it easier to digest. After milling (hulling), the rice is polished, resulting in a seed with a bright, white, shiny appearance.
